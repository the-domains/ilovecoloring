I love designing coloring pages and books, particularly dog themed. Just because I'm dog crazy. I think dogs really show their personalities in their faces and their emotions in their expressions. I always know when the bigger of my two dogs, Lulu, wants her favorite doggy ice cream treat. She will stand by my armchair and stare at me very pointedly until I make eye contact. Then she will give a few precise barks, keep looking intently into my eyes and bark some more until I get up and go to the freezer. Too funny. Of course, I am super well-trained and pretty much always give in!
